# teenyweeny

TeenyWeeny is an experimental multi-paradigm general purpose programming language. TeenyWeeny is based on idea that purely functional and procedural paradigms are better suited for different kinds of problems.
Instead of providing both paradigms in one language, TeenyWeeny provides two smaller interoperable languages. One being purely functional and other being procedural.
The functional sub language is called Space and the procedural one is called time.
